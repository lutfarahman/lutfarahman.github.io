# Quantum Error Correction
###### This project explores quantum error correction and stabilization codes through the mini-book 'An Introduction to Quantum Error Correction and Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation' by Abdullah Khalid. This book includes 'On-Paper' and 'Coding' tasks in every chapter which we tried to solve in our way.
